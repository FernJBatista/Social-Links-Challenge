## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It might sound weird, but for this project I wanted to surprise myself and code as much as possible without looking at the final design live. I wanted to test how much I can visualize the code I'm writting and exercise not having to look at the design every 1.6 seconds.


```css
/* First time ever using this sort of color palette. Took it from my own branding to apply it here. I think it made it easier to just pick these, rather than trying to copy the same color code every time and figuring out which is which. */
:root {
    --Isabeline: #F5F3EF; /* Primary Color */
    --Eerie-Black: #1E1E1E; /* Secondary Color */
    --Davys-Gray: #4E4E56; /* Accent Color */
  }
```

### Continued development

I would love to add some sort of movement or extra elements that are interactive, maybe something in the background.
